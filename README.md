## About

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships are marked. The locations of the fleets are 
concealed from the other player.

Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy opossing player's fleet.
